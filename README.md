# Wild Oasis Client Side Website in NextJS

This is a full-stack website built and deployed using the popular Vercel framework called "NextJS". This is the client side website of one of my previous projects [The Wild Oasis](https://wild-oasis-m.vercel.app/login). 

***Live Demo*** : https://wild-oasis-six-tau.vercel.app


# Funcationalities:

-> The user can log in to the website using their google accounts if they want to make any reservations.

-> There are 8 luxury cabins that are available to reserve each with different capacity and prices.

-> The user can edit or delete their already made reservations once they are logged into their account from the "Account" page.


# Technologies Used:

-> Next JS - [ Framework ]

-> React Hooks - [ useState, useTransition etc ]

-> Tailwind CSS - [ Styling the website ]

## Note:

Feel free to use this project and in case of any issues or queries, contact me using my socials in my bio. Happy CodingðŸ˜Š


## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Creating an Environment Variables File:

-> Make a new file in your project folder with the name of '***.env.local***'.

-> Make the following variables in that file:

  => SUPABASE_URL: <Your supabase account url>
  
  => SUPABASE_KEY: < Your supabase API key>

  => NEXTAUTH_URL: <Your NEXT Auth url from nextauth website>

  => NEXTAUTH_SECRET: <Your NEXT Auth secret key from nextauth website>
  
  => AUTH_GOOGLE_ID: <Your google auth id from Google Developer Console>

  => AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET: <Your google auth secret key from Google Developer Console>


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
